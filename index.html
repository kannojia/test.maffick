				            <p>Singing is a tranquil river of emotions which emanates from a singer's soul and ends up resting in the hearts of listeners. As spoken by the maestro Rabindranath Tagore himself, "God respects me when I work ; but God loves me when I sing". Music is a powerful instrument to convey one's emotions whether they be violent or calm, passionate or apathetic, un-yearning or abjuring. For some it is a matter of sheer devotion, for some it is a pilgrimage and for some it is an unparalleled way of expression. Everyone has it somewhere deep inside the heart to perform live on a stage in front of a roaring audience! So wake up and grab the chance to rock the stage with your exhilarating performances. Come and indulge  yourself in the world of music because the story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye. We welcome all those for whom singing is not only a passion but their first love, the secret of their energy. We invite those who find music to be like finding their souls and those who love to see audiences enjoying with them. If you have that fire within you, come to this garden of musical notes - "SWARAANGAN".</p><br>

				        		Style, they say, is a way to say who you are without having to speak. In fact, life is a fashion show and the world is its runway. Fashion is interwoven into the very social fabric of our societal culture. So much so that today no speck of human life remains untouched with fashion.<br>
				        		It is your sartorial signature that casts your ‘first impression’ and perhaps an impression that lasts long.<br>
				        		MANIT, an institute of national importance that is, has aced all domains, and fashion is no exception. The annual cultural fest of MANIT, Maffick, brings you an opportunity to amalgamate your talent, your spontaneity, your confidence, your sartorial taste and your attitude with your fashion sense, and bring the amalgam to the ramp of “Mr and  Miss Maffick”. <br>
				        	</p><br>

				        	<p>The event will be bifurcated into three rounds, a round a day.<br><br>
